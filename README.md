<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This is my first Web3 Project which I made to enhance my blockchain skills. After following [Alchemy University](https://university.alchemy.com/) for over 6 weeks, I decided to made a simple full-stack decentralized app which allows a user to connect their Metamask or any other crypto wallet and send me some Sepolia test ether.

Here's what I learnt:
* To stucture a [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/) project with a frontend application like [React](https://react.dev/)
* To deploy [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) smart contracts
* How to connect a crypto wallet with your application
* How to call functions of a smart contract deployed on-chain using frontend.

This project really helped me to solidify my understanding of how Dapps are created and deployed and I hope will really help me in future!
